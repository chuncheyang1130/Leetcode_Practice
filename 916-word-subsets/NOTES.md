### Implementation
- Store the maximum appearence of each character within a string of word2
- Through the above method, we can check whether each string in word1 will meet the minimum requirement of appearence of each character
- Ex, aab, bcc, abc are in word2, then string in word1 must have 2 a, 1 b, 2 c in it so that it satisfy the requirement of the problem
​
### Complexity
- O(max(words1 length, words2 length)) in time
- O(1) in extra space
