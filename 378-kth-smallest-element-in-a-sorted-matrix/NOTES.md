### Implementation
- Do binary search for the answer, use the smallest number as left pole, and largest number as right pole
- Count how many numbers in the matrix is smaller than or equal to the average of left and right pole number -> readjust the left and right pole
​
### Complexity
- O(log(range of interger)) in time
- O(1) in space
