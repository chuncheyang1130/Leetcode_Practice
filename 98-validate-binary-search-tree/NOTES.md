### Implementation
- Use the idea of binary search
- When checking left subtree, the maximum value would be the current node, minimum stays the same
- When checking right substree, the minimum value would be the current node, maximum stays the same
​
### Complexity
- O(n) in time
- O(n) in extra space at most
